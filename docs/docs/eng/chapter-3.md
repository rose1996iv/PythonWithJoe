### 3.1 Identifiers and Keywords

Python is a **case sensitive** language. Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other object. Rules for creating identifiers:
- Starts with **alphabet** or an **underscore.**
- Followed by zero or more letters, _ , and digits.
- keyword cannot be used as identifier.
All keywords are in lowercase. Python has **33** keywords shown in *Table 3.1*

|Table 3.1 Keywords list|-/-|-/-|-/-|
|---|---|---|---|
|False|continue|from|not|
|None|def|global|or|
|True|del|if|pass|
|and|elif|import|raise|
|as|else|in|return|
|assert|except|is|try|
|break|finally|lambda|while|
|class|for|nonlocal|with|
|yield|

You can print a list of Python keywords through the statements:

```python title="checking keyword list"
import keyword # makes the module 'keyword' available
print(keyword.kwlist) # syntax modulename.object/function
```

### 3.2 Python Types

**Python** supports 3 categories of data types:

- Basic Types: 
    * int, float, complex, bool, string, bytes
- Container Types:
    * list, tuple, set, dict
- User-defined types:
    * class

Out of these, basic types will be covered in this chapter in detail. **Container types** will be covered briefly. A separate chapter is dedicated to each **container type**, where they are covered in greate detail. **User-defined types** will not be covered in this chapter. **Chapter 17** discusses how to create and use them. 

---

#### 3.2.1 Basic Types

Examples of different basic types are given below:

* **int** can be expressed in binary, decimal, octal, hexadecimal
* **binary** starts with 0b/0B, octal with 0o/0O, hex with 0x/0X (eg. 0b10111, 156, 0o432, 0x4A3)
* **float** can be expressed in fractional or exponential form (eg. 314.1528, 3.141528e2, 3.141528E2)
* **complex** contains real and imaginary part (eg. 3 + 2j, 1 + 4J)
* **bool** can take any of the two Boolean values both starting in caps (eg.True, False)
* **string** is an immutable collection of Unicode characters enclosed within `' '`, `" "`, or `""" """`. 'Rosanna', "Rosanna", """Rosanna""".
* **bytes** represent binary data

```python title="bytes example"
b'\xa1\xe4\x56' # represents 3 bytes with hex values a1a456
```
Type of particular data can be checked using a function called **type( )**
as shown below:
```python title="checking type of data using type() function"
print(type(35)) # prints <class 'int'>
print(type(3.14)) # prints <class 'float'>
```
#### 3.2.2 Integer and Float Ranges

*int* can be of any arbitrary size
```python title="integer example"
a = 123
b = 1234567890
c = 123456789012345678901234567890
```
Python has arbitrary precision integers. Hence you can create as big integers as you want. Moreover, arithmetic operations can be performed on integers without worrying about overflow/underflow.

**Floats** are represented internally in binary as **64-bit** double-precision values, as per the **IEEE 754 standard**. As per this standard, the maximum value a float can have is approximately 1.8 x 10^308. A number greater than this is represented as *inf(short for infinity)*.

Many floats cannot be represented 'exactly' in binary form. So the internal representation is often an approximation of the actual value. 

The difference between the actual value and the represented value is very small and should not usually cause significant problems.

### 3.3 Variable Type and Assignment

There is no need to define type of a variable. During execution the type of the variable is inferred from the context in which it is being used. Hence Python is called **dynamically-typed language.**

```python title="Variable type"
a = 25 # type of a is inferred as int
a = 31.4 # type of a is inferred as float
a = 'Hi' # type of a is inferred as str
```

Type of a variable can be checked using the built-in function **type()**. 

```python title="str variable"
a = 'Job Kaa'
print(type(a)) # type will be reported as str
```

Simple variable assignment:

```python title="assignment example"
a = 10 
pi = 3.14 
name = 'Rosanna'
```

Multiple variable assignment:

```python title="multiple assignment example"
a = 10 ; pi = 31.4 ; name = 'Rosanna' # use ; as statement separator
a, pi, name = 10, 3.14, 'Rosanna'
a = b = c = d = 5 
```

#### 3.3.1 Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators: **`+, - , * , /, %, //, **`**

```python title="Arithmetic Operators"
a = 4 / 2 # performs true division and yields a float 2.0
a = 7 % 2 # % yields remainder 1
b = 3 ** 4 # ** yields 3 raised to 4 (exponentiation)
c = 4 // 3 # // yields quotient 1 after discarding fractional part
```

**In-place assignment operators** offer a good shortcut for arithmetic operations. These include **`+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=`**.

```python title="In-place assignment"
a **= 3 # same as a = a ** 3
b %= 10 # same as b = b % 10
```

### 3.3.2 Operation Nuances

On performing floor division **a//b**, result is the largest integer which is less than or equal to the quotient. **//** is called floor **division operator.**

```python title="Floor Division"
print(10 // 3) # yields 3
print(-10 // 3) # yields -4
print(10 // -3) # yields -4
print(-10 // -3) # yields 3
print(3 // 10) # yields 0
print(3 // -10) # yields -1
print(-3 // 10) # yields -1
print(-3 // -10) # yields 0
```

In **-10 // 3**, multiple of 3 which will yield -10 is -3.333, whose floor 
value is -4.
In **10 // -3**, multiple of -3 which will yield 10 is -3.333, whose floor 
value is -4.
In **-10 // -3**, multiple of -3 which will yield -10 is 3.333, whose floor 
value is 3.

**print( )** is a function which is used for sending output to screen. It can be used in many forms. They are discussed in **Chapter 7**.
Operation **a % b** is evaluated as **a - (b * (a // b))**. This can be best understood using the following examples:

```python title="print functions"
print(10 % 3) # yields 1
print(-10 % 3) # yields 2
print(10 % -3) # yields -2
print(-10 % -3) # yields -1
print(3 % 10) # yields 3
print(3 % -10) # yields -7
print(-3 % 10) # yields 7
print(-3 % -10) # yields -3
```

Since **`a % b`** is evaluated as `a - (b * (a // b))`, **`-10 % 3`** is evaluated as `-10 - (3 * (-10 // 3))`, which yields **2**. **`10 % -3`** is evaluated as `10 - (-3 * (10 // -3))`, which yields **-2**, **`-10 % -3`** is evaluated as `-10 - (-3 * (-10 // -3))`, which yields **-1**.

Mathematical rule *`a / b x c`* is same as *`a x c / b`* holds, but not always.

```python title="Mathematical rule"
# following expressions give same results
a = 300 / 100 * 250
a = 300 * 250 / 100

# However, these don't
b = 1e210 / 1e200 * 1e250
b = 1e210 * 1e250 / 1e200 # gives INF
```

Since True is `1` and False is `0`, they can be added. 

```python title="True and False"
a = True + True # yields 2
b = True + False # yields 1
```

### 3.4 Precedence and Associativity

When multiple operators are used in an arithmetic expression, it is 
evaluated on the basis of precedence (priority) of the operators 
used.

Operators in decreasing order of their priority **(PEMDAS)**:

```text title="Precedence of operators"
( ) # Parentheses
** # Exponentiation
*, /, //, % # Multiplication, Division
+, - # Addition, Subtraction
```
If there is a tie between operators of same precedence, it is settled 
using associativity of operators. 

Each operator has either left to right associativity or right to left 
associativity.

In expression `c = a * b / c`, `*` is done before `/` since arithmetic 
operators have left to right associativity.

A complete list of Python operators, their priority and associativity is 
given in **Appendix A**.

#### 3.4.1 Conversions

Mixed mode operations:

- Operation between int and float will yield float.
- Operation between int and complex will yield complex.
- Operation between float and complex will yield complex.

We can convert one numeric type to another using built-in functions 
**int( )**, **float( )**, **complex( )** and **bool( )**.

**Type conversions:**

```python title="Type conversions"
int(float/numeric string) # from float/numeric string to int
int(numeric string, base) # from numeric string to int in base
float(int/numeric string) # from int/numeric string to float
float(int) # from int to float
complex(int/float) # convert to complex with imaginary part 0
complex(int/float, int/float) # convert to complex
bool(int/float) # from int/float to True/False (1/0)
str(int/float/bool) # converts to string
chr(int) # yields character corresponding to int
```

**int( )** removes the decimal portion from the quotient, so always rounds towards zero.

```python title="int()"
a = int(3.33) # yields 3
b = int(-3.33) # yields -3
```

#### 3.4.2 Built-in Functions

Python has many built-in functions that are always available in any part of the program. The print( ) function that we have been using to send output to screen is a built-in function.

Help about any built-in function is available using **help(function)**.

Built-in functions that are commonly used with numbers are given below:

```python title="Built-in functions"
abs(x) # returns absolute value of x
pow(x, y) # returns value of x raised to y
min(x1, x2,...) # returns smallest argument
max(x1, x2,...) # returns largest argument
divmod(x, y) # returns a pair(x // y, x % y)
round(x [,n]) # returns x rounded to n digits after .
bin(x) # returns binary equivalent of x
oct(x) # returns octal equivalent of x
hex(x) # returns hexadecimal equivalent of x
```

Following Python program shows how to use some of these built-in functions:

```python title="Built-in functions"
a = abs(-3) # assigns 3 to a
print(min(10, 20, 30, 40)) # prints 10
print(hex(26)) # prints 1a
```

#### 3.4.3 Built-in Modules

Apart from built-in functions, Python provides many built-in modules. Each module contains many functions. 
For performing sophisticated mathematical operations we can use the functions present in built-in modules **math**, **cmath**, **random**, **decimal**.

```python title="Built-in modules"
math - many useful mathematics functions.
cmath - functions for performing operations on complex numbers.
random - functions related to random number generation.
decimal - functions for performing precise arithmetic operations.
```

Mathematical functions in **math** module:

```python title="Mathematical functions in math module"
pi, e # values of constants pi and e
sqrt(x) # square root of x
factorial(x) # factorial of x
fabs(x) # absolute value of float x
log(x) # natural log of x (log to the base e)
log10(x) # base-10 logarithm of x
exp(x) # e raised to x
trunc(x) # truncate to integer
ceil(x) # smallest integer >= x
floor(x) # largest integer <= x
modf(x) # fractional and integer parts of x
```

**round( )** built-in function can round to a specific number of decimal 
places, whereas **math** module's library functions **trunc( )**, **ceil( )** and **floor( )** always round to zero decimal places.

Trigonometric functions in **math** module:

```python title="Trigonometric functions in math module"
degrees(x) # radians to degrees
radians(x) # degrees to radians
sin(x) # sine of x radians
cos(x) # cosine of x radians
tan(x) # tan of x radians
sinh(x) # hyperbolic sine of x
cosh(x) # hyperbolic cosine of x
tanh(x) # hyperbolic tan of x
acos(x) # cos inverse of x, in radians
asin(x) # sine inverse of x, in radians
atan(x) # tan inverse of x, in radians
hypot(x, y) # sqrt(x * x + y * y)
```

Random number generation functions from **random** module:

```python title="Random number generation functions from random module"
random( ) # random number between 0 and 1
randint(start, stop) # random number in the range
seed( ) # sets current time as seed for random number generation 
seed(x) # sets x as seed for random number generation logic
```
To use functions present in a module, we need to **import** the module 
using the **import** statement.

Following Python program shows how to use some of the functions 
of **math** module and **random** module:

```python title="Using functions from math and random modules"
import math
import random
print(math.factorial(5)) # prints 120
print(math.degrees(math.pi)) # prints 180.0
print(random.random( )) # prints 0.8960522546341796
```
There are many built-in functions and many functions in each built-
in module. It is easy to forget the names of the functions. We can 
get a quick list of them using the following program:

```python title="Getting list of built-in functions"
import math
print(dir(__builtins__)) # 2 underscores before and after builtins
print(dir(math))
```
### 3.5 Container Types

Container types typically refer to multiple values stored together Examples of different basic types are given below:

```python title="Container types"
# list is a indexed collection of similar/dissimilar entities
[10, 20, 30, 20, 30, 40, 50, 10], ['She', 'sold', 10, 'shells'’]
# tuple is an immutable collection
('Rosanna', 34, 4500.55), ('Let Us Python', 350, 195.00)
# set is a collection of unique values
{10, 20, 30, 40}, {'Rosanna', 34, 45000}
# dict is a collection of key-value pairs, with unique key enclosed in 
''
{'ME101' : 'Strength of materials', 'EE101' : 'Electronics'}
```
Values in a list and tuple can be accessed using their position in the 
list or tuple. Values in a set can be accessed using a **for** loop
(discussed in **Chapter 6**). Values in a dictionary can be accessed using 
a **key**. This is shown in the following program:

```python title="Accessing values in container types"
lst = [10, 20, 30, 20, 30, 40, 50, 10]
tpl = ('Let Us Python', 350, 195.00)
s = {10, 20, 30, 40}
dct = {'ME101' : 'SOM', 'EE101' : 'Electronics'}
print(lst[0], tpl[2]) # prints 10 195.0
print(dct['ME101']) # prints SOM
```

#### 3.5.1 Python Type Jargon

Often following terms are used while describing Python types:
  
  * **Collection** - a generic term for container types.
  
  * **Iterable** - means a collection that can be iterated over using a loop.
  
  * **Ordered collection** - elements are stored in the same order in which they are inserted. Hence its elements can be accessed using an index, i.e. its position in the collection.
  
  * **Unordered collection** - elements are not stored in the same order in which they are inserted. So we cannot predict at which position a particular element is present. So we cannot access its elements using a position based index.
  
  * **Sequence** is the generic term for an ordered collection.
  
  * **Immutable** - means unchangeable collection.
  
  * **Mutable** - means changeable collection.

Let us now see which of these terms apply to types that we have seen so far:

* String - ordered collection, immutable, iterable.

* List - ordered collection, mutable, iterable.

* Tuple - ordered collection, immutable, iterable.

* Set - unordered collection, mutable, iterable.

* Dictionary - unordered collection, mutable, iterable.

#### 3.5.2 Comments and Indentation

Comments begin with #.
```python title="Comments begin with #"
# calculate gross salary 
gs = bs + da + hra + ca 
si = p * n * r / 100 # calculate simple interest
```

Multi-line comments should be written in a pair of ''' or """.

```python title="Multi-line comments should be written in a pair of ''' or \"\"\"."
''' Additional program: Calculate bonus to be paid
URL: https://github.com/rose1996iv/Let-Us-Python-Book- (https://github.com/rose1996iv/Let-Us-Python-Book-)
Author: Joseph, Date: 7 Dec 2025 '''
```

Indentation matters! Don’t use it casually. Following code will report 
an error 'Unexpected indent'.

```python title="Indentation matters! Don’t use it casually. Following code will report an error 'Unexpected indent'."
a = 20 
  b = 45 
```

**Multi-lining**

If statements are long they can be written as multi-lines with each line except the last ending with a \.

```python title="Multi-lining"
total = physics + chemistry + maths + \
english + myanmar + history + \
geography + civics 
```
Multi-line statements within `[ ]`, `{ }`, or `( )` don't need \.

```python title="Multi-line" 
days = [ 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', Thursday', 
'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday' ] 
```

### 3.6 Classes and Objects

In Python every type is a class. So **int**, **float**, **complex**, **bool**, **str**, **list**, **tuple**, **set**, **dict** are all classes. These are ready-made classes. Python also permits us to create user-defined classes as we would see in **Chapter 18**

An object is created from a class. A class describes two things—the form an object created from it will take and the methods (functions) that can be used to access and manipulate the object. 

From one class multiple objects can be created. When an object is created from a class, it is said that an instance of the class is being created.

A class has a name, whereas objects are nameless. Since objects do not have names, they are referred using their addresses in memory.

All the above statements can be verified through the following program. Refer to **Observation** to understand it better.

```python title="All the above statements can be verified through the following program."
a = 30
b = 'Good'
print(a, b) # prints 3 Good
print(type(a), type(b)) # prints <class 'int'> <class 'str'>
print(id(a), id(b)) # prints 1356658640 33720000
print(isinstance(a, int), isinstance(b, str)) # prints True True
```

### 3.7 Python Object Reference Visualization

Understanding how variables refer to objects in memory is crucial in Python.


!!! info "Key Concept"
    In Python, variables are essentially **references** (or pointers) to **objects** stored in memory. They do not contain the values directly but point to the memory location where the value is stored.

## Memory Reference Breakdown

The following table details the references shown in the diagram:

| Variable Name | Reference ID (Address) | Points To (Object Type) | Object Value | Object Memory Address |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`a`** | `1356658640` | **int object** | `30` | `1356658640` |
| **`b`** | `33720000` | **str object** | `Good` | `33720000` |

!!! note "Observation"
    * **Variable `a`** holds the reference ID `1356658640`, which matches the address of the **Integer Object** `30`.
    * **Variable `b`** holds the reference ID `33720000`, which matches the address of the **String Object** `'Good'`.

In this program we have created two objects—one from ready-made class **int** and another from ready-made class **str**.

The object of type **int** contains 30, whereas the object of type **str** contains 'Good'. 

Both the objects are nameless. Their addresses in memory are 
`1356658640` and `33720000` which are stored in `a` and `b`. 

These addresses can be obtained using the built-in function **id( )**. When you execute the program you may get different addresses.

Since `a` and `b` contain addresses they are said to refer to objects 
present at these addresses. In simpler words they are pointers to 
objects.

Type of objects to which `a` and `b` are referring to can be obtained 
using the built-in function **type( )**.

Whether `a` refers to an instance of class **int** can be checked using 
the built-in function **isinstanceof( )**.

**Multiple Objects**

Consider the following program:

```python title="Multiple Objects"
a = 3
b = 3
print(id(a), id(b)) # prints 1356658640 1356658640
print(a is b) # prints True
a = 30 # now a refers to a different object
print(id(a)) # prints 1356659072
```

Are we creating 2 **int** objects? No. Since the value stored in **int** object is same, i.e. 3, only 1 **int** object is created. Both `a` and `b` are referring to the same **int** object. That is why `id(a)` and `id(b)` return same addresses.

This can also be verified using the is operator. It returns True since `a` and `b` both are referring to the same object.

When we attempt to store a new value in `a`, a new **int** object is created as a different value, 30, is to be stored in it. `a` now starts referring to this new **int** object, whereas `b` continues to refer to **int** object with value 3.

Instead of saying that `a` is referring to an **int** object containing a value 3, it is often said that `a` is an **int** object, or 3 is assigned to `a`.

Many programmers continue to believe that `a` and `b` are **int** variables, which we now know is not the case.



### Problem 3.1

a = int('485') # from numeric string to int
b = int('768') # from numeric string to int
c = a + b 
print(c)
print(int('1011', 2)) # convert from binary to decimal int 
print(int('341', 8)) # convert from octal to decimal int 
print(int('21', 16)) # convert from hex to decimal int 

# convert to float
print(float(35)) # from int to float

!!! note "Tips"
    * It is possible to convert a binary numeric string, octal numeric string or hexadecimal numeric string to equivalent decimal integer. Same cannot be done for a **float**.
    * While converting to complex if only one argument is used, imaginary part is considered to be `0`.
    * Any non-zero number (int or float) is treated as **True**. `0` is treated as **False**.

### Problem 3.4

</details>

!!! note "Tips"
    * **divmod(a, b)** yields a pair  **(a // b, a % b)**.
    * **bin( )**, **oct( )**, **hex( )** return binary, octal and hexadecimal equivalents.
    * **round(x)** assumes that rounding-off has to be done with 0 places beyond decimal point.

    * **floor( )** rounds down towards negative infinity, **ceil( )** rounds up towards positive infinity, **trunc( )** rounds up or down towards 0.
    * **trunc( )** is like **floor( )** for positive numbers.
    * **trunc( )** is like **ceil( )** for negative numbers.
    * **modf( )** returns a pair of numbers `(f, i)` such that `x = f + i` and `0 <= f < 1.`

### Problem 3.6

!!! note "Tips"
    * It is necessary to import **random** module. 
    * If we seed the random number generation logic with current time, we get different random numbers on each execution of the program. 
    * **random.seed( )** with no parameter also seeds the logic with current time.
