### 8.1 Lists

Container is an entity which contains multiple data items. It is also known as a collection or a compound data type. 

Python has following container data types: 

- Lists Tuples 
- Sets Dictionaries 

A list can grow or shrink during execution of the program. Hence it is also known as a dynamic array. Because of this nature of lists they are commonly used for handling variable length data. 

A list is defined by writing comma-separated elements within [ ]. 
```python title="Defining lists"
num = [10, 25, 30, 40, 100] 
names = ['Shine', 'Anna', 'Rosanna', 'Superior'] 
```

List can contain dissimilar types, though usually they are a collection of similar types. For example: 
```python title="List containing dissimilar types"
animal = ['Zebra', 155.55, 110] 
```

Items in a list can be repeated, i.e. a list may contain duplicate items. 
Like printing, `*` can be used to repeat an element multiple times. An empty list is also feasible. 
```python title="Repeating list elements"
ages = [25, 26, 25, 27, 26] # duplicates allowed 
num = [10] * 5 # stores [10, 10, 10, 10, 10] 
lst = [ ] # empty list, valid 
```

### 8.2 Accessing List Elements 

Entire list can be printed by just using the name of the list. 
```python title="Printing list"
l = ['Able', 'was', 'I', 'ere', 'I', 'saw', 'elbA'] 
print(l) 
```
Like strings, individual elements in a list can be accessed using indices. Hence they are also known as sequence types. The index value starts from 0. 
```python title="Accessing list elements"
print(animals[1], ages[3])  
```
Like strings, lists can be sliced. 
```python title="Slicing lists"
print(animals[1:3]) 
print(ages[3:]) 
```
### 8.3 Looping in Lists 
If we wish to process each item in the list, we should be able to iterate through the list. This can done using a while or for loop. 
```python title="Looping through a list"
animals = ['Zebra', 'Tiger', 'Lion', 'Jackal', 'Kangaroo'] 
# using while loop 
i = 0 
while i < len(animals) : 
print(animals[ i ]) 
i += 1 
# using more convenient for loop 
for a in animals : 
print(a) 
```
While iterating through a list using a for loop, if we wish to keep track of index of the element that a is referring to, we can do so using the built-in `enumerate( )` function. 
```python title="Iterating through a list using enumerate()"
animals = ['Zebra', 'Tiger', 'Lion', 'Jackal', 'Kangaroo'] 
for index, a in enumerate(animals) : 
print(index, a) 
```

### 8.4 Basic List Operations 

**Mutability** - Unlike strings, lists are mutable (changeable). So lists can be updated as shown below: 
```python title="Mutating lists"
animals = ['Zebra', 'Tiger', 'Lion', 'Jackal', 'Kangaroo'] 
ages = [25, 26, 25, 27, 26, 28, 25] 
animals[2] ='Rhinoceros' 
ages[5] = 31 
ages[2:5] = [24, 25, 32] # sets items 2 to 5 with values 24, 25, 32 
ages[2:5] = [ ] # delete items 2 to 4 
```

**Concatenation** - One list can be concatenated (appended) at the end of another as shown below: 
```python title="Concatenating lists"
lst = [12, 15, 13, 23, 22, 16, 17] 
lst = lst + [33, 44, 55] 
print(lst) # prints [12, 15, 13, 23, 22, 16, 17, 33, 44, 55] 
```
**Merging** - Two lists can be merged to create a new list. 
```python title="Merging lists"
s = [10, 20, 30] 
t = [100, 200, 300] 
z = s + t 
print(z) # prints [10, 20, 30, 100, 200, 300] 
```

**Conversion** - A string/tuple/set can be converted into a list using the `list( )` conversion function. 
```python title="Converting string to list"
lst = list('Africa') # converts the string to a list ['A', 'f', 'r', 'i', 'c', 'a'] 
```

**Aliasing** - On assigning one list to another, both refer to the same list. Changing one changes the other. This assignment is often known as shallow copy or aliasing. 
```python title="Aliasing a list"
lst1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
lst2 = lst1 # doesn't copy list. lst2 refers to same list as lst1 
print(lst1) # prints [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
print(lst2) # prints [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
lst1[0] = 100 
print(lst1[0], lst2[0]) # prints 100 100 
```         

**Cloning** - This involves copying contents of one list into another. After copying both refer to different lists, though both contain same values. Changing one list, doesn't change another. This operation is often known as deep copy. 
```python title="Cloning a list"
lst1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
lst2 = [ ] # empty list 
lst2 = lst2 + lst1 # lst1, lst2 refer to different lists 
print(lst1) # prints [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
print(lst2) # prints [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
lst1[0] = 100 
print(lst1[0], lst2[0]) # prints 100, 10
```
**Searching** - An element can be searched in a list using the in membership operator as shown below: 
```python title="Searching in a list"
lst = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] 
res = 'a' in lst # return True since 'a' is present in list 
res = 'z' not in lst # return True since 'z' is absent in list 
```

**Identity** - Whether the two variables are referring to the same list can be checked using the is identity operator as shown below: 
```python title="Checking identity of lists"
lst1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
lst2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
lst3 = lst1 
print(lst1 is lst2) # prints False 
print(lst1 is lst3) # prints True 
print(lst1 is not lst2) # prints True 
```
- Note the difference for basic types like int or str: 
```python title="Checking identity of basic types"
num1 = 10 
num2 = 10 
s1 = 'Hi' 
s2 = 'Hi' 
print( num1 is num2) # prints True 
print( s1 is s2) # prints True 
```

**Comparison** - It is possible to compare contents of two lists. Comparison is done item by item till there is a mismatch. In following code it would be decided that a is less than b when 3 and 5 are compared. 
```python title="Comparing lists"
a = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
b = [1, 2, 5] 
print(a < b) # prints True 
```

**Emptiness** - We can check if a list is empty using not operator. 
```python title="Checking emptiness of a list"
lst = [ ] 
if not lst : 
print('Empty list') 
```

- Alternately, we can convert a list to a bool and check the result. 

```python title="Checking emptiness of a list"
lst = [ ] 
print(bool(lst)) # prints False 
```

Also note that the following values are considered to be False: 
```python title="Checking emptiness of a list"
None 
Number equivalent to zero: 0, 0.0, 0j 
Empty string, list and tuple: ' ', "", [ ], ( ) 
Empty set and dictionary: { } 
```

### 8.5 Using Built-in Functions on Lists 

Many built-in functions can be used with lists. 
```python title="Using built-in functions on lists"
len(lst) # return number of items in the list 
max(lst) # return maximum element in the list 
min(lst) # return minimum element in the list 
sum(lst) # return sum of all elements in the list 
any(lst) # return True if any element of lst is True 
all(lst) # return True if all elements of lst are True 
del( ) # deletes element or slice or entire list 
sorted(lst) # return sorted list, lst remains unchanged 
reversed(lst) # used for reversing lst 
```
Except the last 3, other functions are self-explanatory. `sorted( )` and `reversed( )` are discussed in section after next. `del( )` function's usage is shown below: 
```python title="Using del( ) function"
lst1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
lst = del(lst[3]) # delete 3rd item in the list 
del(lst[2:5]) # delete items 2 to 4 from the list 
del(a[:]) # delete entire list 
lst = [ ] # another way to delete an entire list 
```

If multiple variables are referring to same list, then deleting one doesn't delete the others. 
```python title="Using del( ) function"
lst1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
lst3 = lst2 = lst1 # all refer to same list 
lst1 = [ ] # lst1 refers to empty list; lst2, lst3 to original list 
print(lst2) # prints [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
print(lst3) # prints [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

If multiple variables are referring to same list and we wish to delete all, we can do so as shown below: 
```python title="Using del( ) function"
lst2[:] = [ ] # list is emptied by deleting all items 
print(lst2) # prints [ ] 
print(lst3) # prints [ ] 
```
### 8.6 List Methods 

Any list is an object of type list. Its methods can be accessed using the syntax lst.method( ). Usage of some of the commonly used methods is shown below: 
```python title="Using list methods"
lst = [12, 15, 13, 23, 22, 16, 17] # create list 
lst.append(22) # add new item at end 
lst.remove(13) # delete item 13 from list 
lst.remove(30) # reports valueError as 30 is absent in lst 
lst.pop( ) # removes last item in list 
lst.pop(3) # removes 3rd item in the list 
lst.insert(3,21) # insert 21 at 3rd position 
lst.count(23) # return no. of times 23 appears in lst 
idx = lst.index(22) # return index of item 22 
idx = lst.index(50) # reports valueError as 50 is absent in lst 
```

### 8.7 Sorting and Reversing 
Usage of list methods for reversing a list and for sorting is shown below: 
```python title="Using list methods"
lst = [10, 2, 0, 50, 4] 
lst.reverse( ) 
print(lst) # prints [4, 50, 0, 2, 10] 
lst.sort( ) 
print(lst) # prints [0, 2, 4, 10, 50] 
lst.sort(reverse = True) # sort items in reverse order 
print(lst) # prints [50, 10, 4, 2, 0] 
```

- Note that `reverse( )` and `sort( )` do not return a list. Both manipulate the list in place. 

Usage of built-in functions for reversing a list and for sorting is shown below: 
```python title="Using built-in functions"
lst = [10, 2, 0, 50, 4] 
print(sorted(lst)) # prints [0, 2, 4, 10, 50] 
print(sorted(lst, reverse = True)) # prints [50, 10, 4, 2, 0] 
print(list(reversed(lst))) # prints [4, 50, 0, 2, 10]
```
- Note that `sorted( )` function returns a new sorted list and keeps the original list unchanged. Also, `reversed( )` function returns a `list_reverseiterator` object which has to converted into a list to get a reversed list. 

Reversal is also possible using a slicing operation as shown below: 
```python title="Using slicing operation"
lst = [10, 2, 0, 50, 4] 
print(lst[::-1]) # prints [0, 2, 4, 10, 50] 
```

### 8.8 List Varieties 

It is possible to create a list of lists (nested lists). 
```python
a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] 
b = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] 
c = [a, b] 
print(c[0][0], c[1][2]) # 0th element of 0th list, 2nd ele. of 1st list 
```

A list may be embedded in another list. 
```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
y = [10, 20, x, 30] 
print(y) # outputs [10, 20, [1, 2, 3, 4], 30] 
```
It is possible to unpack a string or list within a list using the `*`operator. 
```python
s = 'Hello' 
l = [*s] 
print(l) # outputs ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'] 

x = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
y = [10, 20, *x, 30] 
print(y) # outputs [10, 20, 1, 2, 3, 4, 30] 
```

### 8.9 Stack Data Structure 

A data structure refers to an arrangement of data in memory. Popular data structures are stack, queue, tree, graph and map. 

Stack is a last in first out (LIFO) list, i.e. last element that is added to the list is the first element that is removed from it. 

Adding an element to a stack is called push operation and removing an element from it is called pop operation. Both these operations are carried out at the rear end of the list. 

Push and pop operations can be carried out using the `append( )` and `pop( )` methods of list object. This is demonstrated in *Program 8.3.*



### 8.10 Queue Data Structure 

Queue is a first in first out (FIFO) list, i.e. first element that is added to the list is the first element that is removed from it. 

Lists are not efficient for implementation of queue data structure. 

With lists removal of items from beginning is not efficient, since it involves shifting of rest of the elements by 1 position after deletion. 

Hence for fast additions and deletions, `dequeue` class of `collections` module is preferred. 

Deque stands for double ended queue. Addition and deletion in a deque can take place at both ends. 

Usage of deque class to implement a queue data structure is 
demonstrated in *Program 8.4.*

## **Exercises**


### **[A] What will be the output of the following programs:**

a.
```python
msg = list('https://github.com/rose1996iv')(https://github.com/rose1996iv)
ch = msg[-1] 
print(ch) 
```

b. 
```python
msg = list('www.google.com') 
s = msg[4:6] 
print(s) 
```
c. 
```python 
msg = 'Online Courses - Beacon' 
s = list(msg[:3]) 
print(s) 
```

d. 
```python 
msg = 'Beacon Academy' 
s = list(msg[-5:-2]) 
print(s) 
```

e. 
```python
s = list('Beacon') 
t = s[::-1] 
print(t) 
```

f. 
```python
num1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
num2 = num1 
print(id(num1)) 
print(type(num2)) 
print(isinstance(num1, list)) 
print(num1 is num2) 
```

g. 
```python
num = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
num[2:4] = [ ] 
print(num) 
```
h. 
```python
num1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
num2 = [60, 70, 80] 
num1.append(num2) 
print(num1) 
```
i. 
```python
lst = [10, 25, 4, 12, 3, 8] 
sorted(lst) 
print(lst)
``` 
j. 
```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
b = [1, 2, 5] 
print(a < b) 
```
### **[B] Attempt the following questions:**

a. Which of the following is a valid List? 

```python
['List']    {"List"}    ("List")    "List" 
```
b. What will happen on execution of the following code snippet? 
```python
s = list('Hello') 
s[1] = 'M' 
```

c. The following code snippet deletes elements 30 and 40 from the list: 
```python 
num = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
del(num[2:4]) 
```
In which other way can the same effect be obtained? 

d. Which of the following is an INCORRECT list? 

```python 
a = [0, 1, 2, 3, [10, 20, 30]] 
a = [10, 'Suraj', 34555.50] 
a = [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60]] 
```

e. From the list given below 
```python 
num1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
```
How will you create the list num2 containing: 
```python
['A', 'B', 'C', 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 'Y', 'Z'] 
```

f. Given a list 
```python
lst = [10, 25, 4, 12, 3, 8] 
```
How will you sort it in descending order? 

g. Given a list 
```python
lst = [10, 25, 4, 12, 3, 8] 
```
How will you check whether 30 is present in the list or not? 

h. Given a list 
```python
lst = [10, 25, 4, 12, 3, 8] 
```
How will you insert 30 between 25 and 4? 

i. Given a string 
```python 
s = 'Hello' 
```
How will you obtain a list `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']` from it? 

### **[C] Answer the following questions:**

a. Write a program to create a list of 5 odd integers. Replace the third element with a list of 4 even integers. Flatten, sort and print the list. 

b. Suppose a list contains 20 integers generated randomly. Receive a number from the keyboard and report position of all occurrences of this number in the list. 

c. Suppose a list has 20 numbers. Write a program that removes all duplicates from this list. 

d. Suppose a list contains positive and negative numbers. Write a program to create two lists—one containing positive numbers and another containing negative numbers. 

e. Suppose a list contains 5 strings. Write a program to convert all these strings to uppercase. 

f. Write a program that converts list of temperatures in Fahrenheit degrees to equivalent Celsius degrees. 

g. Write a program to obtain a median value of a list of numbers, without disturbing the order of the numbers in the list. 

h. A list contains only positive and negative integers. Write a program to obtain the number of negative numbers present in the list. 

i. Suppose a list contains several words. Write a program to create another list that contains first character of each word present in the first list. 

j. A list contains 10 numbers. Write a program to eliminate all duplicates from the list.
