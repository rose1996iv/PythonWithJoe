### 9.1 Tuples

What are Tuples?

- Though a list can store dissimilar data, it is commonly used for storing similar data.
- Though a tuple can store similar data it is commonly used for storing dissimilar data. The tuple data is enclosed within ( ) as shown below

```python title="Defining tuples"
a = ( ) # empty tuple
b = (10,) # tuple with one item. , after 10 is necessary
c = ('Sunny', 25, 34555.50) # tuple with dissimilar items
d = (10, 20, 30, 40) # tuple with similar items
```

- While creating the tuple `b`, if we do not use the comma after 10, `b` is treated to be of type `int`.

While initializing a tuple, we may `drop ( )`.
```python title="Defining tuples"
c = 'Sunny', 25, 34555.50 # tuple with multiple items
print(type(c)) # c is of the type tuple
```

Items in a tuple can be repeated, i.e. tuple may contain duplicate items. However, unlike list, tuple elements cannot be repeated using a `*`.
```python title="Defining tuples"
tpl1 = (10,) * 5 # stores (10, 10, 10, 10, 10)
tpl2 = (10) * 5 # stores (50)
```

### 9.2 Accessing Tuple Elements

Entire tuple can be printed by just using the name of the tuple.

```python title="Defining tuples"
tpl = ('Sunny', 25, 34555.50) 
print(tpl)
```

Tuple is an ordered collection. So order of insertion of elements in a tuple is same as the order of access. So like a string and list, tuple items too can be accessed using indices, starting with 0.

```python title="Defining tuples"
msg = ('Handle', 'Exceptions', 'Like', 'a', 'boss')
print(msg[1], msg[3])
```

Like strings and lists, tuples too can be sliced to yield smaller tuples.
```python title="Defining tuples"
emp = ('Sunny', 23, 23000, 1760, 2040)
print(emp[1:3]) # prints (23, 23000)
print(emp[3:]) # prints (1760, 2040)
print(emp[:3]) # prints ('Sunny', 23, 23000)
```
### 9.3 Looping in Tuples

If we wish to process each item in a tuple, we should be able to iterate through it. This can be done using a while loop or for loop.
```python title="Defining tuples"
tpl = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
i = 0
while i < len(tpl) :
    print(tpl[i])
    i += 1
for n in tpl :
    print(n)
```

While iterating through a tuple using a for loop, if we wish to keep track of index of the element that is being currently processed, we can do so using the built-in enumerate( ) function.
```python title="Defining tuples"
tpl = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
for index, n in enumerate(tpl) :
    print(index, n)
```

### 9.4 Basic Tuple Operations

Mutability - Unlike a list, a tuple is immutable, i.e. it cannot be modified.
```python title="Defining tuples"
msg = ('Fall', 'In', 'Line') 
msg[0] ='FALL' # error
msg[1:3] = ('Above', 'Mark') # error
```
Since a tuple is immutable operations like append, remove and insert do not work with a tuple.
```python title="Defining tuples"
msg = ('Fall', 'In', 'Line') 
msg.append('Like') # error
msg.remove('Line') # error
msg.insert(1, 'Above') # error
```

Though a tuple itself is immutable, it can contain mutable objects like lists.
```python
# mutable lists, immutable string—all can belong to tuple
s = ([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5], 'Ocelot')
```
If a tuple contains a list, the list can be modified since list is a mutable object. 
```python
s = ([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20], 'Oynx')
s[1][1] = 45 # changes first item of first list, i.e. 20
print(s) # prints ([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 45], 'Oynx')

# one more way to change first item of first list
p = s[1]
p[1] = 100
print(s) # prints ([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 100], 'Oynx')
```

The other basic operations that are done on a tuple are very similar to the ones done on a list. These operations are discussed in **Chapter 8**. You may try the following operations on tuples as an exercise:

- Concatenation
- Merging
- Conversion
- Aliasing
- Cloning
- Searching
- Identity
- Comparison
- Emptiness

### 9.5 Using Built-in Functions on Tuples

Many built-in functions can be used with tuples.
```python 
t = (12, 15, 13, 23, 22, 16, 17) # create tuple
len(t) # return number of items in tuple t
max(t) # return maximum element in tuple t
min(t) # return minimum element in tuple t
sum(t) # return sum of all elements in tuple t
any(t) # return True if any element of tpl is True
all(t) # return True if all elements of tpl are True
sorted(t) # return sorted list (not sorted tuple)
reversed(t) # used for reversing t
```

### 9.6 Tuple Methods

Any tuple is an object of type tuple. Its methods can be accessed using the syntax tpl.method( ). Usage of two methods is shown below:
```python
tpl = (12, 15, 13, 23, 22) # create tuple
print(tpl.count(23)) # return no. of times 23 appears in lst
print(tpl.index(22)) # return index of item 22
print(tpl.index(50)) # reports valueError as 50 is absent in lst
```

### 9.7 Tuple Varieties

It is possible to create a tuple of tuples.
```python
a = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
b = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
c = (a, b)
print(c[0][0], c[1][2]) # 0th element of 0th tuple, 2nd ele of 1st tuple

records = (

('Priya', 24, 3455.50), ('Sunny', 25, 4555.50), 
('Sunday', 25, 4505.50), ('Sonia', 27, 4455.55) 

) 
print(records[0][0], records[0][1], records[0][2])
print(records[1][0], records[1][1], records[1][2])
for n, a, s in records :
print(n,a,s)    
```
A tuple may be embedded in another tuple.
```python
x = (1, 2, 3, 4)
y = (10, 20, x, 30) 
print(y) # outputs (10, 20, (1, 2, 3, 4), 30)
```
It is possible to unpack a tuple within a tuple using the `*`operator.
```python
x = (1, 2, 3, 4) 
y = (10, 20, *x, 30)
print(y) # outputs (10, 20, 1, 2, 3, 4, 30)
```
It is possible to create a list of tuples, or a tuple of lists.

```python
lst = [('Priya', 24, 3455.50), ('Sunny', 25, 4555.50)]
tpl = (['Priya', 24, 3455.50], ['Sunny', 25, 4555.50])
```
If we wish to sort a list of tuples or tuple of lists, it can be done as follows:
```python
import operator
# each embedded tuple/list contains name, age, salary
lst = [('Shailesh', 24, 3455.50), ('Priyanka', 25, 4555.50)]
tpl = (['Shailesh', 24, 3455.50], ['Priyanka', 25, 4555.50])
print(sorted(lst))
print(sorted(tpl))
print(sorted(lst, key = operator.itemgetter(2)))
print(sorted(tpl, key = operator.itemgetter(2)))
```
By default, `sorted( )` sorts by first item in list/tuple, i.e. name. 

If we wish to sort by salary, we need to use the `itemgetter( )` function of operator module.

The key parameter of `sorted( )` requires a key function (to be applied to objects to be sorted) rather than a single key value.

`operator.itemgetter(2)` will give us a function that fetches salary from a list/tuple.

In general, `operator.itemgetter(n)` constructs a function that takes a list/tuple as input, and fetches the n-th element out of it.

## Problems

### Problem 8.1

Pass a tuple to the divmod( ) function and obtain the quotient and the remainder.

<details> <summary> Program </summary>

```python
result = divmod(17,3)
print(result)
t = (17, 3)
result = divmod(*t)
print(result)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
(5, 2)
(5, 2)
```
</details>
!!! Tips "Tips"
    - If we pass t to divmod( ) an error is reported. We have to unpack the tuple into two distinct values and then pass them to `divmod( )`. `divmod( )` returns a tuple consisting of quotient and remainder.

### Problem 8.2

Write a Python program to perform the following operations:

- Pack first 10 multiples of 10 into a tuple
- Unpack the tuple into 10 variables, each holding 1 value
- Unpack the tuple such that first value gets stored in variable x, last value in y and all values in between into disposable variables _
- Unpack the tuple such that first value gets stored in variable i, last value in j and all values in between into a single disposable variable _

<details> <summary> Program </summary>

```python
tpl = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 8, 90, 100)
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j = tpl
print(tpl)
print(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j)
x, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, y = tpl
print(x, y, _)
i, *_, j = tpl
print(i, j, _)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 8, 90, 100)
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 8 90 100
10 100 90
10 100 [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 8, 90]
```
</details>

!!! Tips "Tips"
    - Disposable variable _ is usally used when you do not wish to use the variable further, and is being used only as a place-holder.


### Problem 8.3

A list contains names of boys and girls as its elements. Boys' names are stored as tuples. Write a Python program to find out number of boys and girls in the list.

<details> <summary> Program </summary>

```python
lst = ['Susanne', 'Nancy', 'Joshua', ('Susan',), ('Rose',), 'Ryan']
boys = 0
girls = 0
for ele in lst:
   if isinstance(ele, tuple):
      boys += 1
   else :
      girls += 1
print('Boys = ', boys, 'Girls = ', girls)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
Boys = 2 Girls = 4
```
</details>

!!! Tips "Tips"
    - `isinstance( )` functions checks whether ele is an instance of tuple type.
    - Note that since the tuples contain a single element, it is followed by a comma.


### Problem 8.4

A list contains tuples containing roll number, names and age of student. Write a Python program to gather all the names from this list into another list.

<details>
<summary> Program </summary>

```python
lst = [('A101', 'Susanne', 23), ('A104', 'Nancy', 25), ('A111', 'Joshua', 24)]
nlst = [ ]
for ele in lst:
nlst = nlst + [ele[1]]

print(nlst)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
['Susanne', 'Nancy', 'Joshua']
```
</details>

!!! Tips "Tips"
    - `nlst` is an empty to begin with. During each iteration name is extracted from the tuple using `ele[1]` and added to the current list of names in `nlst`.


### Problem 8.5

Given the following tuple `('F', 'l', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'e', 'r', 'g', 'a', 's', 't', 'e', 'd')`, write a Python program to carry out the following operations:

- Add an ! at the end of the tuple
- Convert a tuple to a string
- Extract ('b', 'b') from the tuple
- Find out number of occurrences of 'e' in the tuple
- Check whether 'r' exists in the tuple
- Convert the tuple to a list
- Delete characters 'b, 'b', 'e', 'r' from the tuple

<details>
<summary> Program </summary>

```python
tpl = ('F', 'l', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'e', 'r', 'g', 'a', 's', 't', 'e', 'd')
# addition of ! is not possible as tuple is an immutable
# so to add ! we need to create a new tuple and then make tpl refer to it
tpl = tpl + ('!',)
print(tpl)
# convert tuple to string
s = ''.join(tpl)
print(s)

# extract ('b', 'b') from the tuple
t = tpl[3:5]
print(t)

# count number of 'e' in the tuple
count = tpl.count('e')
print('count = ', count)

# check whether 'r' exists in the tuple
print('r' in tpl)

# Convert the tuple to a list
lst = list(tpl)
print(lst)

# tuples are immutable, so we cannot remove elements from it
# we need to split the tuple, eliminate the unwanted element and then 
merge the tuples
tpl = tpl[:3] + tpl[7:]
print(tpl)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
('F', 'l', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'e', 'r', 'g', 'a', 's', 't', 'e', 'd', '!')
Flabbergasted!
('b', 'b')
count = 2
True
['F', 'l', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'e', 'r', 'g', 'a', 's', 't', 'e', 'd', '!']
('F', 'l', 'a', 'g', 'a', 's', 't', 'e', 'd', '!')
```
